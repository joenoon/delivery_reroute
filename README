Delivery Reroute
================

Contact: Joe Noon - joe[at]stat.im

All emails will be sent to the address you specify instead of to the defined recipients.

Example config/development.rb configuration:

config.after_initialize do
  ActionMailer::Base.delivery_method = :reroute                # sets that you want to reroute all emails
  ActionMailer::Base.delivery_reroute_method = :smtp           # sets that you want to use your underlying smtp settings
  ActionMailer::Base.delivery_reroute_to = 'joe@example.com'   # sets the address that receives all emails
end
